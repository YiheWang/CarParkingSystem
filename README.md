Our goal is to use lighting number of LEDs to show distance between objects.

1) Use distance sensor HC-HR04 to detect distance. 
2) Short distance means less lighting LED, long distance means more lighting LED.
3) Detecting distance from 10cm to 74cm, corresponding to 16 LEDs.
4) Arduino 16 LEDs Using Two 74HC595 Shift Registers (unlimited Pins)
